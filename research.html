    <article>

        <p>
            Company Online Safari, an assignment given to research companies that I would like to work for.
    </p>
    <p> Since I don't know the path that I want to follow I chose companies by their working culture:</p>

    <h1>Bolt</h1>
        <code> The first tech unicorn to <b>permanently</b> switch to a 4 day work week </code>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Their working culture is being flexible and give the employee a feeling of ownership.
            </li>

            <li>
                Bolt is an Estonian mobility company that offers vehicle for hire, micromobility, car-sharing, and food delivery services headquartered in Tallinn and operating in over 500 cities in more than 45 countries.
        </li>

            <li>
                The IT Roles are: Engineering, Data Science and analytics
            </li>
            <li>
                Technologies: AWS, AZURE, JAVA, C++, OOP
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1> Booking.com</h1>
        <code> the best paying I.T company in Nl outside FAANG</code>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Money is important
            </li>
            <li>
                They are not static, an employee moves around according to their company needs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Technologies: JAVA, JAVASCRIPT AND JQUERY.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h1> Google </h1>
        <code> Who wants to be a Noogler?</code>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Google advocates flexibility, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, pointed out in an email to his employees that "We'll move to a hybrid work week when most Googlers spend approximately three days in the office and two days wherever they work best."
            </li>

            <li>
                Technologies: Google uses JavaScript and TypeScript in the front-end, and C++, Java, Golang, Python, and PHP in the back-end.
            </li>
        </ul>
